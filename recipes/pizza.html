  <h1>PIZZA</h1>
  <img src="https://imag.bonviveur.com/pizza-margarita.jpg">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. Here's an example of a pizza:</p>

  <h3>Pizza Margherita</h3>
  <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>100ml Mutti Tomato Passata</li>
    <li>2 tbsp chopped basil leaves, plus small leaves to garnish</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 bocconcini, sliced 1cm thick</li>
    <li>2 tbsp freshly grated parmesan</li>
    <li>8 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil, to drizzle</li>
    <li>2 cups (300g) strong (baker's) flour (see note), plus extra to dust</li>
    <li>7g sachet dry active yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to grease</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PREPARATION</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For the pizza bases, sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in yeast, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the centre and add 200ml warm water with the oil. Bring together with a wooden spoon or your hands, then turn out dough onto a floured surface. Knead for 5 minutes by hand (or in an electric mixer with a dough hook) until the dough is smooth..</li>
    <li>Lightly grease the cleaned bowl with a little oil, then add dough and cover with a tea towel. Set aside in a warm place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 240Â°C. Knock back the dough by punching it to remove air and divide into 2 balls. Roll dough out on a floured surface until you have 2 very thin, 25cm-diameter pizza bases. Carefully transfer to 2 lightly floured baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.</li>
    <li>Combine passata or sugo with basil and garlic, then spread over pizza bases leaving a 2cm border. Divide the bocconcini between bases, then scatter with parmesan and cherry tomatoes (cutside up). Drizzle with olive oil and bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese has melted and the pizza bases are crisp and lightly golden around the edges.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the pizzas with a little more olive oil, garnish with small basil leaves then serve immediately.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
