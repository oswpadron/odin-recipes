  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>Japanese culture and it's biggest treasure: is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked). Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Here's an example of a sushi dish:</p>

  <h3>California Roll</h3>
  <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1.- 2 cups sushi rice(460 g), cooked</li>
    <li>2.- Â¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar(60 mL)</li>
    <li>3.- 4 half sheets sushi grade nori</li>
    <li>4.- 1 teaspoon sesame seed, optional</li>
    <li>5.- 8 pieces imitation crab</li>
    <li>6.- 1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
    <li>7.- 1 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
  </ul>
  <p>PREPARATION</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until room temperature.</li>
    <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.</li>
    <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without mashing the rice down. Season rice with a pinch of sesame seeds, if using, then flip it over so the nori is facing upwards.</li>
    <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab followed by a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.</li>
    <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.</li>
    <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
